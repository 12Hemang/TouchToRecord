TouchToRecord - Like Vine Instagram Whatsapp Video Recorder
=============

This code just provide a way to record audio and video separately and then merge them both using ffmpeg command, so that we can have pause/record function for user.

Touch/Press android camera surface view to record video using FFmpeg Recorder from JavaCV.
Using this I have implemented Vine like touch and hold video recording feature.

It will stop recording the video when user will lift the finger from camera surface view.
User can pause and continue video recording after any interval of time.
Once user have finished recording the video, click next to play the recorded video.

LICENSE:

As I have mentioned earlier there is No License restriction from me but JAVACV license has to be obeyed as I have made this code with Genious Samuel Audet code.
But frequently I have been getting message like 

"I guess the original library (https://github.com/qdrzwd/VideoRecorder) ........."

I have emailed that guy to give credits but he refused as you have not set any License I am open to do anything.
This affects me when I send resume to good company and my resume does not get selected if they think I have copied code.
Please give me credits in your github repo at least, so that I dont get such comments.
I will be highly thankful to you.
