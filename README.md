TouchToRecord - Like Vine Recorder
=============

This code just provide a way to record audio and video separately and then merge them both using ffmpeg command, so that we can have pause/record function for user.

Touch android camera surface view to record video using FFmpeg Recorder from JavaCV.
JavaCvVideoRecorder is an Android Library project.
Using this I have implemented Vine like touch and hold video recording feature.

Demo app will record video while user will touch the camera surface view.
It will stop recording the video when user will lift the finger from camera surface view.
User can continue recording same video recording after any interval of time.
Once user have finished recording the video, click stop to save the video.
