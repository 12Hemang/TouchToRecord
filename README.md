TouchToRecord - Like Vine Instagram Whatsapp Video Recorder
=============

This code just provide a way to record audio and video separately and then merge them both using ffmpeg command, so that we can have pause/record function for user.

Touch/Press android camera surface view to record video using FFmpeg Recorder from JavaCV.
Using this I have implemented Vine like touch and hold video recording feature.

It will stop recording the video when user will lift the finger from camera surface view.
User can pause and continue video recording after any interval of time.
Once user have finished recording the video, click next to play the recorded video.
